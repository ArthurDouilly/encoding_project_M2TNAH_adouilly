<!-- The elements listed below are used for encoding the body of the document. I have chosen not to include front or back matter since the documents 
are archives rather than books, but added the 'salute' and 'signed' elements as a result of the structure of a testament, which include a traditional 
invocation as well as a closer explaining the material conditions and the context of writing of the testament -->
