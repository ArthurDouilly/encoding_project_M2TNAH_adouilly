# Selected testaments of the Nicola√ø family

### Description of the source material

The testaments that I have chosen to use for this project were written by members of a family of *nobles of the robe* at the tail end of the 18th century, the Nicolay, who were the object of my research during my master's degree in 2018-2020. Some of these testaments were first transcribed by Arthur de Boislisle as part of a family-commissioned book on the family's history in 1873-1875, in a compendium which is available on Gallica, although I have also transcribed the original archives in some cases due to editing choices made by my predecessor.

### Why I have chosen these documents as source material

I have chosen them because they are documents on which I have worked extensively in the past and which, in part due to the long timespan in between them, exhibit both similarities in structure and key differences in word choices. As such, it is useful to compare them and see how they can be distinguished, as well as what they have in common.

### How XML can be used to help structure and enrich these documents

XML can be used to list the names of the people which are mentioned in the testament, to establish links in between them, and to underline how the authors make their demands. Finally, it is useful to show off the underlying structure of a testament, the expected elements and the references which one makes in a document meant to expedite their affairs after their death in the 18th century and beyond.
